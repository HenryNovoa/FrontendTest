## Technical Description

This is a first iteration of the Frontend test you sent me.
As a second iteration I would try to make it the view responsive and construct view.js using components. I spent about 12 hours in total working on this as this is was my first technical test after the bootcamp and had to refresh on vanilla Javascript as I have been working for the past month and a half with React + Node.
